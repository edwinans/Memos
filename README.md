# Memos
A simple memo(simple bloc of texts) managing web application.

# Installation and Execution
Just pull the project and then replace credentials in  the `/src/db/config_db.js` for connecting to your local mysql server. <br/>
After that just open a terminal and tap `npm start` so you will see some tables created in your mysql database.
As you can see the port that the express server is listening into is 8080, so you can run the web application simply by entering `http://localhost:8080` in the url bar of your favorite browser(Firefox, Chrome,...).
